        Based on Tobin James, The World Wide Web (WWW), known as the Web, is an
        information system where documents and other web resources are
        identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which may be interlinked
        by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        In this page we will explore concepts related to Web's function.

      <p class="text">
        The Internet is practically the tool that connects computers
        (university, governmental etc) all around the world, creating eventually
        a network.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        What really is the Internet? Let's listen to one of the "fathers" of the
        Internet, Vint Cerf, well..., and some confused people like us, giving
        their overview.

    <section id="how-internet-works">
      <h2 class="headings">So how does the Internet work?</h2>

      <p class="text">
        Apart from the connection, the Internet makes sure to choose the way
        messages from one computer to another will be passed on, creating
        protocols, which are eventually being broken down to pieces called
        packets.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        Protocols? Packets? What are these? Before we jump on this terms, let's
        watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/128575085"> this video</a> on how the
        internet works.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Internet Protocols  -->
    <section id="internet-protocols">
      <h3 class="headings">Internet Protocols</h3>
      <img

        alt="Internet Protocols"
        width="520"
        height="330"
      />
      <p class="text">
        As we saw, internet protocols are rules that determine how messages will
        be addressed and passed on in the network of computers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Packets (TCP/UDP)  -->
    <section id="packets">
      <h3 class="headings">Packets (TCP/UDP)</h3>
      <img
        class="im"
        src="images/packets-flow.png"
        alt="Packets"
        width="520"
        height="330"
      />
      <p class="text">
        However, if the message is too big, protocols are broken down in
        packets. Each packet has information about how packets fit together, as
        well as information about the sender and the recipient of the message.

          >TCP and UDP</a
        >
        are the most common protocols. The following video will give a general
        overview about their function.

    <!-- IP Addresses  -->
    <section id="IP">
      <h3 class="headings">IP Addresses</h3>

      <p class="text">
        Each computer on the internet (yes, that is right, even the own on which
        you are browsing this webpage) has a unique numeric address called IP
        address.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Are you curious about your IP? Find it in this
        <a href="https://www.whatismyip.com/">Domain server</a>, which is
        something like an address book.

    </section>

    <!-- Routers  -->
    <section id="Routers">
      <h3 class="headings">Routers</h3>

      <p class="text">
        Routers are the guides. In other words, their purpose is to "guide" the
        packets through the internet. As soon as the packets arrive to their
        destination, the information embedded in each packet tell how to put all
        the packets back together.

    <section id="DNS">
      <h2 class="DNS">DNS</h2>

      <p class="text">
        DNS is short for Domain Name System and it is a translation system we
        cam use to search on the internet. In other words, when we search for
        Facebook or Wikipedia or any domain name, typing in human language, the
        browser checks is one of them has the domain's IP address.

      <h2 class="HTTP">HTTP</h2>

      <p class="text">
        HTTP or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is an application which defines the
        message structure between the browser and the webserver that is actually
        deliver this application. Thanks to WWW in 90s, HTML was develop
        (basically the process of creating a link on a text) that led to HTTP.

      <p class="text">
        Last but not least, HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the actual

        webpage.
